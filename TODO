Add extensions as a requirement to go to next room stage

Implement a flag system to place banks/links/caches/towers
Clear out room.building.controller and use that
Only check flags when the room stage is in a state that needs it to progress
Terms, in order of implementation:
ex-1 to 60
cont-cache-1 cont-cache-2 & cont-bank
tower-1 to 6
storage-bank
link-1 to 2 & link-bank
spawn-2 to 3

Long term:
Spawn a new miner before the old one dies, so no downtime.
to do this, have a nextMinerName on a MySource, swap it over when minerName is null
When the miner arrives at the cache pos, have a key called minerTravelTime (in ticks). Set it every time.
In the spawning logic, just check if the tickstolive of the miner is <= minerTravelTime.
Problem is they'll just get later and later unless it measures it to 1 move AWAY from the cachePos...
