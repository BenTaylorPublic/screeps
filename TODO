If the room setup is deterministic, logic after attack should be the same as logic as building
myContainers should be removed.
It should be an x y of the location of source caches, assigned to a MySource
Haulers should be assigned to sources too
myBankContainerPos should be a RoomPosition
Miners and haulers should not use IDs of containers, just RoomPosition
This will mean the only things that use IDs are Sources (not changing based on construction or destruction)

Remove automated base placing

I really need to split up controller.logic1.ts
In fact controller.logic should be nothing but calling other modules
main:
memory.controller
room.creepSpawning.controller
