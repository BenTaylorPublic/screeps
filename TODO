Long term:
Spawn a new miner before the old one dies, so no downtime.
to do this, have a nextMinerName on a MySource, swap it over when minerName is null
When the miner arrives at the cache pos, have a key called minerTravelTime (in ticks). Set it every time.
In the spawning logic, just check if the tickstolive of the miner is <= minerTravelTime.
Problem is they'll just get later and later unless it measures it to 1 move AWAY from the cachePos...
