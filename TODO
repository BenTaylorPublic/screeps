1. Rework room stage logic.
Because caches have 500 decay time, MinerAndWorker must be used till RCL 3.
-1  = no controller
0   = rcl 0
1   = rcl 1
2   = rcl 2
2.2 = rcl 3, start building tower
2.4 = tower built, start building containers
2.6 = caches and bank built, start creating miners and haulers
2.8 = miners and haulers all assigned
3   = bank hit cap, spawn builders



RCL LEVELS:
Lvl Req         Buildings
1	200	        Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn
2	45,000	    Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn, 5 Extensions (50 capacity), Ramparts (300K max hits), Walls
3	135,000	    Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn, 10 Extensions (50 capacity), Ramparts (1M max hits), Walls, 1 Tower
4	405,000	    Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn, 20 Extensions (50 capacity), Ramparts (3M max hits), Walls, 1 Tower, Storage
5	1,215,000	Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn, 30 Extensions (50 capacity), Ramparts (10M max hits), Walls, 2 Towers, Storage, 2 Links
6	3,645,000	Roads, 5 Containers, 1 Spawn, 40 Extensions (50 capacity), Ramparts (30M max hits), Walls, 2 Towers, Storage, 3 Links, Extractor, 3 Labs, Terminal
7	10,935,000	Roads, 5 Containers, 2 Spawns, 50 Extensions (100 capacity), Ramparts (100M max hits), Walls, 3 Towers, Storage, 4 Links, Extractor, 6 Labs, Terminal
8	-	        Roads, 5 Containers, 3 Spawns, 60 Extensions (200 capacity), Ramparts (300M max hits), Walls, 6 Towers, Storage, 6 Links, Extractor, 10 Labs, Terminal, Observer, Power Spawn

WORK 100
MOVE 50
CARRY 50
